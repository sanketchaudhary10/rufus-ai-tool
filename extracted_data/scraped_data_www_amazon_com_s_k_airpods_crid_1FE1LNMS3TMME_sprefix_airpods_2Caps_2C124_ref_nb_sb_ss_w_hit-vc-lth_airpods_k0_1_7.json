One Medical members receive ongoing support for their healthcare needs, using the One Medical app to book in-office doctors\u2019 appointments at locations near them, and to request 24/7 on-demand virtual care at no extra cost. Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit gives Amazon customers the option to seek out one-time virtual visits for 30+ common conditions.How is One Medical Membership different from Amazon One Medical Pay-per-visit? Which should I choose?Amazon One Medical gives people two ways to get medical care: Membership and Pay-per-visit.Membership provides on-demand virtual care nationwide for ongoing support of healthcare needs, and a differentiated primary care experience if you live near a One Medical office. One Medical members can use the One Medical app to access 24/7 on-demand virtual care at no extra cost, including Urgent Video Chats. They can also use the app to message with their providers, easily request prescription refills and renewals, access their health records and care plans, and book same and next-day appointments for remote or in-person visits. Scheduled visits are billed to you or your insurance, with most major insurance plans accepted. One Medical memberships can be purchased by Prime members for $9/mo or $99/yr for the first member and $6/mo or $66/yr for each additional family member (maximum 5).
