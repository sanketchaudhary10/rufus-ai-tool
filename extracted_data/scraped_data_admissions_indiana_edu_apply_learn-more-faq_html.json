        "Several factors influence the timing of when a student will receive a response to their application including, but not limited to:When the application is received. While the applications open as early as August 1, historically over 50% of students applying for the fall term complete their application within the last 10 days of October. This large number of applications in a very short time period requires sufficient time for processing and review.Additional time for review. We take a holistic approach to reviewing applications and are always looking for reasons to admit. All students who complete their application by the November 1 early action deadline will receive a response on or before January 15. Students who complete their application by the February 1 regular decision deadline will receive a response on or before March 15.Space availability in desired program.

Many of these programs are rated among the highest in the nation and draw strong interest from students around the world. To look for opportunities to offer admission to as many students as possible and honor their interests we may take a little longer in our review.",
